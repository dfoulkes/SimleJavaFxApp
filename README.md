# Simple App

## introduction

this is a simple app to show how a users and roles should be separated for a login screen.

## Notes 

1. to ensure that Roles and Users are unique we store them in the controller in a set and override the hashcode and equals methods.
other these methods are available on any java object.

2. to make things easier to construct I created builder classes. (look up the builder design pattern)
